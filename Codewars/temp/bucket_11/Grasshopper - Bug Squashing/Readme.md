#### Terminal game bug squashing
You are creating a text-based terminal version of your favorite board game. In the board game, each
turn has six steps that must happen in this order: roll the dice, move, combat, get coins, buy more
health, and print status.
<br>

You are using a library that already has the functions below. Create a function named main that
calls the functions in the proper order.
```
- `combat`
- `buy_health`
- `get_coins`
- `print_status`
- `roll_dice`
- `move`
```
