Ahoy Matey!
<br>

Welcome to the seven seas.
<br>

You are the captain of a pirate ship.
<br>

You are in battle against the royal navy.
<br>

You have cannons at the ready.... or are they?
<br>

Your task is to check if the gunners are loaded and ready, if they are: `Fire!`
<br>

If they aren't ready: `Shiver me timbers!`
<br>

Your gunners for each test case are 2, 3 or 4.
<br>

When you check if they are ready their answers are in a dictionary and will either be: `aye` or
`nay`
<br>

Firing with less than all gunners ready is non-optimum (this is not fire at will, this is fire by
the captain's orders or walk the plank, dirty sea-dog!)
<br>

If all answers are 'aye' then Fire! if one or more are 'nay' then Shiver me timbers!
