-------------

You are given a method called `main`, make it print the line `Hello World!`, (yes, that includes a
new line character at the end) and don't return anything
<br>

Note that for some languages, the function `main` is the entry point of the program.
<br>

Here's how it will be tested:
```
Solution.main("parameter1", "parameter2","parametern")
```
<br>

Hints:
1. Check your references
2. Think about the scope of your method
3. For prolog you can use write but there are [better
   ways](https://gist.github.com/dtonhofer/20bd01f68a924912771d8405fca66a09)
4. If you still don't get it probably you can define main as an attribute of the Solution class that
   accepts a single argument, and that only prints "Hello World!" without any return.
