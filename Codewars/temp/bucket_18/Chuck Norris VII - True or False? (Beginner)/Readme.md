-------------

It's a well known fact that anything Chuck Norris wants, he gets. As a result Chuck very rarely has
to use the word false.
<br>

It is a less well known fact that if something is true, and Chuck doesn't want it to be, Chuck can
scare the truth with his massive biceps, and it automatically becomes false.
<br>

Your task is to be more like Chuck (ha! good luck!). You must return false without ever actually
using the word false...
<br>

Go show some truth who's boss!
