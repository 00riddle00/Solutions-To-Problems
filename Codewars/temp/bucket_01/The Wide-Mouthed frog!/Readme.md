-------------

The wide-mouth frog is particularly interested in the eating habits of other creatures.
<br>

He just can't stop asking the creatures he encounters what they like to eat. But, then he meets the
alligator who just LOVES to eat wide-mouthed frogs!
<br>

When he meets the alligator, it then makes a tiny mouth.
<br>

Your goal in this kata is to create complete the `mouth_size` method this method takes one argument
`animal` which corresponds to the animal encountered by the frog. If this one is an `alligator`
(case-insensitive) return small otherwise return `wide`.
