-------------

Here is a piece of code:
```
def get_status(is_busy):
    status = "busy" if is_busy else "available"
    return status
```
<br>

#### Expected Behaviour
Function should return a dictionary/Object/Hash with `"status"` as a key, whose value can: `"busy"`
or `"available"` depending on the truth value of the argument `is_busy`.

This code has several bugs, please fix them.
