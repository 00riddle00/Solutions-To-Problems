-------------

Your collegue wrote an simple loop to list his favourite animals. But there seems to be a minor
mistake in the grammar, which prevents the program to work. Fix it! :)
<br>

If you pass the list of your favourite animals to the function, you should get the list of the
animals with orderings and newlines added.
<br>

For example, passing in:
```
animals = [ 'dog', 'cat', 'elephant' ]
```
<br>

will result in:
```
list_animals(animals) == '1. dog\n2. cat\n3. elephant\n'
```
