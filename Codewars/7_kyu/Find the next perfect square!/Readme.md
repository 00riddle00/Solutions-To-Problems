-------------

You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?
<br>

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed
as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an
integer.
<br>

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the
parameter is non-negative.
<br>

Examples (Input --> Output):
```
121 --> 144
625 --> 676
114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square
```
