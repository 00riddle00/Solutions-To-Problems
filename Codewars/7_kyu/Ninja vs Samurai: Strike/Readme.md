-------------

Something is wrong with our Warrior class. The strike method does not work correctly. The following
shows an example of this code being used:
```
ninja = Warrior('Ninja')
samurai = Warrior('Samurai')

samurai.strike(ninja, 3)
# ninja.health should == 70
```

Can you figure out what is wrong?
