-------------

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a chemical found in the nucleus of cells and carries the
"instructions" for the development and functioning of living organisms.
<br>

In DNA strings, symbols "A" and "T" are complements of each other, as "C" and "G". Your function
receives one side of the DNA (string, except for Haskell); you need to return the other
complementary side. DNA strand is never empty or there is no DNA at all (again, except for Haskell).

Example: (input --> output)
```
"ATTGC" --> "TAACG"
"GTAT" --> "CATA"
```
