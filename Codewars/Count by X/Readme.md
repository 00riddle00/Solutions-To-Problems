-------------

Create a function with two arguments that will return an array of the first `n` multiples of `x`.
<br>

Assume both the given number and the number of times to count will be positive numbers greater than
`0`.
<br>

Return the results as an array or list ( depending on language ).
<br>

Examples
```
count_by(1,10) #should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
count_by(2,5) #should return [2,4,6,8,10]
```
