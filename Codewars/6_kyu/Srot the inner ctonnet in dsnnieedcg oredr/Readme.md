-------------

You have to sort the inner content of every word of a string in descending order.
<br>

The inner content is the content of a word without first and the last char.
<br>

Some examples:
```
"sort the inner content in descending order"  -->  "srot the inner ctonnet in dsnnieedcg oredr"
"wait for me"        -->  "wiat for me"
"this kata is easy"  -->  "tihs ktaa is esay"
```
<br>
Words are made up of lowercase letters.
<br>

The string will never be null and will never be empty. In C/C++ the string is always nul-terminated.
