-------------

Inspired by the development team at Vooza, write the function that
* accepts the name of a programmer, and
* returns the number of lightsabers owned by that person.
<br>

The only person who owns lightsabers is Zach, by the way. He owns 18, which is an awesome number of
lightsabers. Anyone else owns 0.
<br>

Note: your function should have a default parameter.
<br>

For example(Input --> Output):
```
"anyone else" --> 0
"Zach" --> 18
```
