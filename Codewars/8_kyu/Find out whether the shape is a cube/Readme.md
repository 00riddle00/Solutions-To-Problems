-------------

To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:
<br>

`volume = Length * Width * Height`
<br>

But someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!
<br>

It's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).
<br>

Return `true` if the cuboid could have equal sides, return `false` otherwise.
<br>

Return `false` for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).
<br>

Note: side will be an integer
