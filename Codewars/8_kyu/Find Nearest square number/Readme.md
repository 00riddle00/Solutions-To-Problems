-------------

Your task is to find the nearest square number, `nearest_sq(n)` or `nearestSq(n)`, of a positive
integer `n`.
<br>

For example, if `n = 111`, then `nearest_sq(n)` (`nearestSq(n)`) equals 121, since 111 is closer to
121, the square of 11, than 100, the square of 10.
<br>

If the `n` is already the perfect square (e.g. `n = 144`, `n = 81`, etc.), you need to just return
`n`.
<br>

Good luck :)
