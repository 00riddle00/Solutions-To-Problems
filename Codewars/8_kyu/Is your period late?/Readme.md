-------------

In this kata, we will make a function to test whether a period is late.
<br>

Our function will take three parameters:
<br>

last - The Date object with the date of the last period
<br>

today - The Date object with the date of the check
<br>

cycleLength - Integer representing the length of the cycle in days
<br>

Return true if the number of days passed from last to today is greater than cycleLength. Otherwise,
return false.
