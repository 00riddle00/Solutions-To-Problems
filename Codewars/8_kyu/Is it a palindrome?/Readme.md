Write a function that checks if a given string (case insensitive) is a
[palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome). A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or
other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar, the
date and time 12/21/33 12:21, and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama".
