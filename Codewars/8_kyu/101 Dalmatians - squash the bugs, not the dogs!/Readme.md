-------------

Your friend has been out shopping for puppies (what a time to be alive!)... He arrives back with
multiple dogs, and you simply do not know how to respond!
<br>

By repairing the function provided, you will find out exactly how you should respond, depending on
the number of dogs he has.
<br>

The number of dogs will always be a number and there will always be at least 1 dog.
<br>

Good luck!
