-------------

You're at the zoo... all the meerkats look weird. Something has gone terribly wrong - someone has
gone and switched their heads and tails around!
<br>

Save the animals by switching them back. You will be given an array which will have three values
(tail, body, head). It is your job to re-arrange the array so that the animal is the right way round
(head, body, tail).
<br>

Same goes for all the other arrays/lists that you will get in the tests: you have to change the
element positions with the same exact logics
<br>

Simples!
