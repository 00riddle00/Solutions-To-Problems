#### No Loops Allowed

You will be given an array `a` and a value `x`. All you need to do is check whether the provided
array contains the value, without using a loop.
<br>

Array can contain numbers or strings. `x` can be either. Return `true` if the array contains the
value, `false` if not. With strings you will need to account for case.
