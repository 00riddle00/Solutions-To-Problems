-------------

In this Kata we are passing a number (n) into a function.
<br>

Your code will determine if the number passed is even (or not).
<br>

The function needs to return either a true or false.
<br>

Numbers may be positive or negative, integers or floats.
<br>

Floats with decimal part non equal to zero are considered UNeven for this kata.
