Problem description at Codewars can be found
[here](https://www.codewars.com/kata/56aed32a154d33a1f3000018/train/python).

-------------

#### Overview
In this Kata you should fix/create a program that returns the following values:

* `false/False` if either `a` or `b` (or both) are not numbers
* `a % b` plus `b % a` if both arguments are numbers
<br>

You may assume the following:
1. If `a` and `b` are both numbers, neither of `a` or `b` will be `0`.

#### Language-Specific Instructions
##### Javascript and PHP
In this Kata you should try to fix all the syntax errors found in the code.
<br>

Once you think all the bugs are fixed run the code to see if it works. A correct solution should
return the values specified in the overview.
<br>

Extension: Once you have fixed all the syntax errors present in the code (basic requirement), you
may attempt to optimise the code or try a different approach by coding it from scratch.
