-------------

You are required to create a simple calculator that returns the result of addition, subtraction,
multiplication or division of two numbers.
<br>

Your function will accept three arguments:

The first and second argument should be numbers.

The third argument should represent a sign indicating the operation to perform on these two numbers.
<br>

if the variables are not numbers or the sign does not belong to the list above a message "unknown
value" must be returned.
<br>

#### Example:
```
calculator(1, 2, '+') => 3
calculator(1, 2, '$') # result will be "unknown value"
```
