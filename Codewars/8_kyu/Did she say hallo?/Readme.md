-------------

You received a whatsup message from an unknown number. Could it be from that girl/boy with a foreign
accent you met yesterday evening?
<br>

Write a simple function to check if the string contains the word hallo in different languages.
<br>

These are the languages of the possible people you met the night before:
* hello - english
* ciao - italian
* salut - french
* hallo - german
* hola - spanish
* ahoj - czech republic
* czesc - polish
<br>

Notes
* you can assume the input is a string.
* to keep this a beginner exercise you don't need to check if the greeting is a subset of word
  (`Halloween` can pass the test)
* function should be case insensitive to pass the tests
