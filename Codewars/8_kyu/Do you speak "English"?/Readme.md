-------------

Given a string of arbitrary length with any ascii characters. Write a function to determine whether
the string contains the whole word "English".
<br>

The order of characters is important -- a string "abcEnglishdef" is correct but "abcnEglishsef" is
not correct.
<br>

Upper or lower case letter does not matter -- "eNglisH" is also correct.
<br>

Return value as boolean values, true for the string to contains "English", false for it does not.
