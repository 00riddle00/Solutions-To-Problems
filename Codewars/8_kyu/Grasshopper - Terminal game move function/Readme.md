-------------

In this game, the hero moves from left to right. The player rolls the dice and moves the number of
spaces indicated by the dice two times.
<br>

Create a function for the terminal game that takes the current position of the hero and the roll
(1-6) and return the new position.
<br>

Example:
```
move(3, 6) should equal 15
```
