-------------

Provided is a function `find` which accepts two parameters in the following order: `array, element`
and returns the index of the element if found and `"Not found"` otherwise.

Your task is to shorten the code as much as possible in order to meet the strict character count
requirements of the Kata.  (no more than 85) You may assume that all array elements are unique.
