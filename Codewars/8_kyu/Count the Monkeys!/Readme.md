-------------

You take your son to the forest to see the monkeys. You know that there are a certain number there
(n), but your son is too young to just appreciate the full number, he has to start counting them
from 1.
<br>

As a good parent, you will sit and count with him. Given the number (n), populate an array with all
numbers up to and including that number, but excluding zero.
<br>

For example (Input --> Output):
```
10 --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 1 --> [1]
```
