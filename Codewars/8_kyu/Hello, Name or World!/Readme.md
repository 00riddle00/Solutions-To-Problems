-------------

Define a method `hello` that `returns` "Hello, Name!" to a given `name`, or says Hello, World! if
name is not given (or passed as an empty String).
<br>

Assuming that `name` is a `String` and it checks for user typos to return a name with a first
capital letter (Xxxx).
<br>

Examples:
```
* With `name` = "john"  => return "Hello, John!"
* With `name` = "aliCE" => return "Hello, Alice!"
* With `name` not given 
  or `name` = ""        => return "Hello, World!"
```
