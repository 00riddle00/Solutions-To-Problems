Hey Codewarrior!
<br>

You already implemented a Cube class, but now we need your help again! I'm talking about
constructors. We don't have one. Let's code two: One taking an integer and one handling no given
arguments!
<br>

Also we got a problem with negative values. Correct the code so negative values will be switched to
positive ones!
<br>

The constructor taking no arguments should assign 0 to Cube's Side property.
