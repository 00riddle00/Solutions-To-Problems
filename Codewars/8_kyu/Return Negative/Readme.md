-------------

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number
is already negative?
<br><br>

Examples
```
make_negative(1);  # return -1
make_negative(-5); # return -5
make_negative(0);  # return 0
```
<br>

Notes
- The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
- Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
